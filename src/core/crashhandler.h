/// Crash handler: Google Breakpad minidumps with local symbolization and a
/// Discord webhook report.
///
/// A port of AcceleratorLocal (asherkin's accelerator by way of komashchenko's
/// fork) into the core. When the server dies on a signal a minidump plus a
/// .txt with the map, game path, command line and console history is written
/// to addons/source2toolkit/dumps/. The next start finds the unprocessed dump,
/// walks its stack, symbolizes every addons/ module in-process straight from
/// the ELF/DWARF on disk -- so no llvm-symbolizer or addr2line is needed
/// inside a bare steamrt container -- prints the stack with the suspected
/// culprit and, when CrashDiscordWebhook is set in the core config, posts it
/// to Discord with the .txt attached.
///
/// Linux only; every function below is a no-op on Windows.

    /// session left behind. Reads CrashHandlerEnabled and CrashDiscordWebhook
