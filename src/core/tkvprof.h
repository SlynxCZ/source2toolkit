// Budget group every scope of the core is filed under: one "Source2Toolkit"
// line in the budget report, next to the game's own groups. A plugin's own
// time spent inside a callback the core dispatches lands under the core's
// scope unless the plugin opens a scope of its own.
#define TK_VPROF_BUDGETGROUP "Source2Toolkit"

// Scope covering the rest of the enclosing block; goes first in a hook
// handler. The name is the node in the report, "Source2Toolkit::<hooked
// function>", kept under 52 characters: the report cuts the Scope column
// there. A Pre and a Post handler are two scopes, so the game's own call
// between them is not counted.
// VPROF_BUDGET and not VPROF: that one is detail level 1, which the SDK's
// default VPROF_LEVEL 0 compiles out. While vprof is off, or off the main
// thread, tier0 returns right at the top of the enter call.
