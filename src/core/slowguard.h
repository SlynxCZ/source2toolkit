/**
 * Slow plugin callbacks, named.
 *
 * Everything a plugin does runs inside a hook of the core, so the engine's
 * frame-time report blames "Source2Toolkit" for a stall wherever it really
 * is: a command handler waiting on a socket, a timer doing a query, an event
 * handler in a loop. The guard times one callback and logs which one, whose,
 * and how long, when it took longer than SlowCallbackWarnMs (core.json).
 * The cost when nothing is slow is two clock reads.
